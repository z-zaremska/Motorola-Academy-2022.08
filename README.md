# Motorola Academy 2022 - Coding task

Hi

First of all I am sorry that the game is in Python. I've started my journey with programming just 4 weeks ago and didn't expect that I am going to take part in recruitment process like this so soon after getting started. Couldn't learn Java in 4 days to write anything that would make sense, so I am giving you what I've got. :D

One month ago after 7 years of being mechanical engineer I've decided to change my life and do something that I was always thinking about. During this past few years everytime when I was talking with my friends about my work, my collegues and my workings environment I was always saying that I'm never going to have such a nice work as programmers, because it is already too late for me to change. And then, last year my friend all of the sudden turned into IT and I realised that it is possible and saying that "it is too late" is not an argument anymore.

So, here I am.
